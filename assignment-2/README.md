# 💼 Personal Portfolio – Assignment 2

## 🧾 Overview
This project is my **personal portfolio web application**, created for **Assignment 2** of the Web Development course.  
It builds on Assignment 1 and introduces **new interactive features**, **data handling**, **animations**, and **AI-assisted improvements**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Proficiency in modern front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- The ability to create dynamic, user-friendly web applications
- Responsible and ethical use of AI tools for coding and learning

## 🌟 Key Features
### 🧩 Dynamic Content
- Personalized greeting that changes based on time or a saved username
- Interactive project list that supports real-time search and filtering
- Expandable project details with smooth animations
- Quote widget that fetches random quotes from a public API

### ⚙️ Data Handling
- User preferences (dark/light theme) stored using **localStorage**
- Fetches dynamic content using the **Quotable API**
- Includes loading, retry, and fallback logic for API errors

- Hover animations for buttons, links, and cards
- Animated feedback for form success or error messages
- Subtle transitions that guide user attention

### 🧠 AI Integration

4. Add the link to this README and submit it on Blackboard.

##  AI Usage 
See `docs/ai-usage-report.md` for full details. Briefly: AI was used to scaffold files, enforce accessibility, and generate placeholder assets—then manually reviewed and adapted.
